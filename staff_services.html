As I've said elsewhere on this site, I think it's courage. Fortitude Counseling is about honoring that courage and partnering with you to strengthen identity, process trauma, and gain momentum where you’re stuck. I believe we all have courage and the "stuff of fortitude" in us. Sometimes we need someone to come alongside us and help us dig deep, find our courage, and let it take root.

Like many counselors, I use several types of therapy so that I can adjust my counseling services to fit each client. The ones I use most are based in Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the Community Resiliency Model (CRM), Eye Movement Desensitization &amp; Reprocessing (EMDR), the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) study, neuroscience, human lifespan development, and attachment theory. If you are new to counseling, you may not be familiar with these terms, and that's okay. During our first session we can talk more about what these mean if you have questions. For now, you may find it useful to know these terms/names if you would like to do your own reading about them. I typically use these therapies to help clients manage their emotions, think about themselves or the world in a healthier way, work through difficult past experiences (including traumatic ones), grow healthy relationships, or stand up for themselves in a way that respects self and others. I tend to think about my clients’ problems through what is called the biopsychosocialspiritual model. This approach acknowledges that each of us is a whole person and that our minds, bodies, spirits, &amp; family/community systems all play a role in the joys and the difficulties we each face. &nbsp;<br></p>

                                    <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">Counseling involves active participation from both the therapist and the client. Positive changes take time and lasting progress can be slow. You will likely find yourself having to practice new habits or ways of thinking over and over before you begin to feel their benefits or see new results. Also, just like with injuries to our bodies, some healing is painful. In therapy some people experience emotional pain even while they are on the path to emotional healing. 
<br>
<br>Since change and healing are processes rather than quick fixes, it is best not to think of therapy sessions as individual lessons or units. Rather, each therapy session is part of the greater process of helping you move toward your goals. Some sessions you may leave feeling relieved, encouraged, or like you have figured something out. Of course, we will aim for some amount of closure within each session, but sometimes this is not possible. You may leave appointments with unanswered questions to think about or difficult emotions to tolerate until we meet again. 
<br>
<br>I truly value honest feedback from my clients, so if you ever feel like you are not making progress the way you would like, I invite you to talk with me about it. For counseling to work, it needs the effort and commitment of the client, as well as a good fit between the individual client and the individual counselor. The therapist’s personality, style, and expertise must be a good fit for the client’s personality, problems, and goals in order for therapy to be truly helpful.<br></p>

                                       I have actually written several, all too lengthy, answers to this question about the role of faith &amp; spirituality in counseling. In the end, I think a short answer is best.<br><br>I view spirituality as part of our lives, in much the same way as our bodies &amp; minds play their own unique-- yet overlapping-- roles. To me, spirituality encompasses how we understand mysteries like intuition or our answers to questions about whether our lives having meaning or whether we as individuals have worth or value. For some people faith, religion, or other spiritual beliefs play a large role in pondering these life questions. I am one of those people. Some of my clients are these people, and some are not. Just like with any other aspect of counseling, I believe my job is to meet you where you are and to help you get where you want to be. I do not have any hidden agendas to change the ways you think, feel, or believe. I attempt to create a space that invites you to honestly and openly acknowledge your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs and determine what, if any, changes <em>you</em> would like to make.<br><br>I identify myself as a Christian and am active in my faith. Some clients seek counseling with me because they too are Christians and purposefully selected a counselor who has a point of reference for what they might believe. Some of my clients practice other religions that they discuss in therapy and others never directly reference what beliefs they hold. Regardless of where your preferences would fit in the groups above, you are welcome to share with me as much or as little of this part of your life as you would like. No matter how you do or don't identify yourself, my goal will be to get to know you and the ways your nuanced belief system impacts the things that bring you to counseling.</p>

I chose it because, while it is true that some counseling is brief and change rapid, when it comes to things like forming or solidifying identity or processing trauma growth is often slow and behind the scenes. This is much like how the long leaf pine develops. I'm no arborist, but my understanding is that while its cousins shoot up rather quickly and experience their (very real) above-ground, visible growth, the long leaf pine sprouts above the ground and looks like a tuft of tall grass, and then stays that way...for years. Above the ground it looks like nothing is happening and often if one doesn't know what to look they may not realize a young long leaf is a tree at all. <br><br>During the years of a long leaf's "grass stage," it takes a measure of faith to believe growth is still happening. But sure enough, under the surface, the long leaf is using its energy to build an expansive root system for itself. Once this root system is established, the tree can shoot up-- very tall-- above the ground and survive high winds, fires, and other crises that would undo it without that strong, enduring root base. <br><br>Sometimes, deep longer term therapy is similar. Profound growth is happening even if the externals</p>
